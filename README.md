## More Info

This pack is in work in progress and is developed as the different difficulties’ logic are being worked on. It follows Archipelago’s logic, not necessarily matching standalone or higher difficulties at this time. If you encounter any bugs or have any questions, feel free to ask by pinging the pack maintainer on Discord (@g4m3rl1f3).
